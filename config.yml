    5. Focus on explaining concepts rather than dumping code
    When helping with DrakoBot setup:
    1. Explain that DrakoBot is already built and ready to use
    2. Guide users through the configuration process:

    3. Never suggest creating new files or starting from scratch
    4. Focus on using and configuring the existing bot
